# 并行计算

**学分**: 4
**授课老师**: 范睿


## 课程评价

稍微有点难的课，英文授课。不过感觉从老师到学生都有些摆, 4 次作业全集中在后半学期才发，2 次 lab 直到快期末了才发第一次，最后把剩下1次砍了；苯人并行计算零基础 + 大四摆烂，听下来感觉懵懵的，纯靠考前翻一翻；个人感官上 coding 有点偏匮乏了，上一半了 cuda 都还没上过手

## 详细信息

### 课件

非常详细，基本包含所有上课内容

### 作业

4 次纸质作业，类似算法设计和分析

2 次编程 lab，分别是 BFS 和 cuckoo hashing。24 FALL 只布置了 cuckoo hashing，cuda 实现 cuckoo hashing table 并完成要求的四个实验

### Project

1-2两人组队

分 Reading Project 和 Programming Project。

For the reading project, present a recent paper on a parallel computing, taken either from the conferences listed below or another source you have.  Clearly describe the problem, its applications, the techniques / algorithms used in the paper to solve the problem, and also related works, eg other approaches to solving the problem.  Your report should show you have a clear understanding of the problem and solution techniques.  Do not copy text from the paper, though you may use diagrams or figures from the paper.  Please write your report in English.  It should be at least 2000 words long and provide enough details.

```
International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS)
Symposium on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming (PPoPP)
Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures (SPAA)
International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)
ACM/IEEE Supercomputing Conference (SC)
International Conference on Supercomputing (ICS)
Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing (PODC)
International Conference on High Performance Computing (HiPC)
International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS)
```
 
For the programming project, choose a problem which is suitable for parallelization, and solve it using the languages and techniques we covered in class.  In particular, you should either write a program to solve your problem, or give an algorithm and prove its correctness and theoretically analyze its performance.  Write a report on your project (English, >= 2000 words) describing your problem, why it's interesting or challenging, the algorithm / techniques you used, the performance / scalability your solution achieves, and also discuss related works on the problem.


### 考试

期中+期末，期中内容到 cuda 之前；设计和分析一些算法，有手写代码和MSI, OpenMP, cuda的 API 环节, 但是不严格要求代码细节、主要写伪代码
